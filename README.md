# Idol-Booth-Cam
It's a booth cam website where anyone can take pictures with their idol group members.
User can select any member of kpop boyband BTS and can take solo pictures too. I have tried my best to make UI simple for smooth user experiance.
User just has to allow website to use device's camera and then select members and take pictures. A user can take maximum 4 images at a time. Then just click on download button.
It is made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I have used the concept of image processing in this project and DOM manipulation in Javascript.
Since I am a hige kpop fan and I also wanted to experience photo booth but as we don't have this in Pakistan, so I thought I should make one. The best part of this is that it is accessible to everyone.
